# ShortFormRules
A webapp for quickly creating and sharing rulesets and supplements for tabletop gaming using a block editor.

## Features
### Block editor
Quickly add markdown text, blockquotes, tables and dice-roll tables, with custom-built editors for each.

### Default sharing
A ruleset is immediately available for other users to view once you hit save, no extra configuration required.

### Choose your system
You can specify what game system the ruleset expands on or modifies, as well as the type of ruleset it is, whether it's a new standalone system, a supplement to an existing one or an encounter / statblock.
